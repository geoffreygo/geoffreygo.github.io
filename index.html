                    <p class="ml-3 mr-3 ">
                        My first computer was a Packard Bell desktop with a 486DX processor, 512KB (yes
                        KB) of RAM, and a 107MB hard drive. My first smartphone was loads more powerful
                        with loads more storage. But at the time, it was amazing. I spent a lot of time
                        browsing through the OS files, teaching myself what the different file
                        extensions signified, opening them to see what was in them, and consequently
                        reinstalling MS-DOS 4 and Windows 3.1 multiple times. I had to upgrade my RAM
                        to 2MB (soooo much RAM) in order to install and play Myst. This led to hours
                        setting up a home ethernet network, digging into the world of TCP/IP and the
                        OSI model, and eventually to an MCSE in Windows NT and then Windows 2000.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-3 mr-3 ">
                        Along the way, I also went through a lot of gadgets. I had a <a href="https://vintagecomputer.com/dauphin-dtr-1-pen-tablet.html" target="_blank">Dauphin DTR-1</a> for
                        awhile; considering that DTR stood for Desktop Replacement, it was quite
                        ambitiously named. I loved my Newton MessagePad 2000 and mourned when Steve
                        Jobs went back to Apple and killed the MessagePad line, although he eventually
                        released the iPad, so I forgave him. I owned several iterations of Compaq iPaqs
                        because I refused to buy a Palm Pilot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-3 mr-3 ">
                        All of this is to say that, from the moment I had a computer of my own, I was
                        driven to understand what made it work, and what I could make it do. I knew
                        that when there was a problem, it was because something was wrong in the
                        software or hardware and that if I understood how they worked, I would
                        eventually be able to figure out and fix these problems; and I was relentlessly
                        driven to do so. I excelled at troubleshooting and knew that the more I knew,
                        the more easily I would be able to troubleshoot and resolve hardware and
                        software issues. IT was constantly evolving, and there was always more to know.

                        I have recently been learning web development, and it has rekindled in me the
                        early excitement and fascination that I had with my first computer and numerous
                        other computing gadgets. Web development is nothing but troubleshooting, and I
                        love it. Scroll down a bit to see how I have fared at it so far.

                                and Matt Brennecke. It
                                utilizes several APIs: Google Maps, Event Registry, and newsapi. The home page is a google maps heatmap
                                of where news stories
                                are across the US. You can either click on the map to zoom into an area or select a State and then City
                                from the dropdowns to
                                get news stories from that area. This is still under development. Other features will include the
                                ability to register and login
                                so that you can save stories or city/area searches. Also, clicking on the map will bring up a list of
                                headlines in that region.
                                Lastly, you will be able to filter your news results by keywords within the region you are searching.

                        <p class="float-left ml-3 mr-3 mb-3 ">Memory Game is my first React app. I used the npm package
                            create-react-app as starter
                            code. React is quite powerful, but also complicated. Using JSX is sometimes intuitive and sometimes arcane.
                            The object is
                            to click on each hero's card without clicking on the same one twice. Sounds easy right? Not so fast! Every
                            time you click
                            on one, they all rearrange on the screen! One amazing aspect of React is the ability to quickly and easily
                            format an array
                            full of objects and put them all on the screen, which is how the cards with the hero's pictures are
                            created. I enjoyed
                            programming this, I hope you enjoy playing it!

                            to get the Gizmodo homepage and then npm package cheerio to get access to the html. This allows me to

                            with node, express, and developing our own API. The back end is MySQL. We use JSON web tokens for
                            authentication and a library
                            called <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/" target="_blank">fullCalendar</a> for the gui calendar. The idea
                            is that small business/gig workers can have clients
                            log in and schedule their own appointments with them. Providers can also create appointments for blocks
                            of time that they don't want clients to schedule them. When registering, providers choose their business
                            hours and these are emphasized in the calendar to show clients where to create appointments. Feel free to
                            register as a client or provider and check it out.

                                by typing the title of a movie in the text box at the right and clicking Add Button.

                                moment.js. There is a form to
                                fill out the details of the train you'd like to track. When you push the Add Train
                                button, your train is added to
                                the list of Train Schedules below the form (and the form's data is stored in firebase).
                                The schedule lets the user
                                know what time the next train will arrive, and how many minutes they have to wait. It
                                refreshes every minute.</p>
