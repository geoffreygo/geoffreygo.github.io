                    <p class="ml-3 mr-3 ">
                        My first computer was a Packard Bell desktop with a 486DX processor, 512KB (yes
                        KB) of RAM, and a 107MB hard drive. My first smartphone was loads more powerful
                        with loads more storage. But at the time, it was amazing. I spent a lot of time
                        browsing through the OS files, teaching myself what the different file
                        extensions signified, opening them to see what was in them, and consequently
                        reinstalling MS-DOS 4 and Windows 3.1 multiple times. I had to upgrade my RAM
                        to 2MB (soooo much RAM) in order to install and play Myst. This led to hours
                        setting up a home ethernet network, digging into the world of TCP/IP and the
                        OSI model, and eventually to an MCSE in Windows NT and then Windows 2000.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-3 mr-3 ">
                        Along the way, I also went through a lot of gadgets. I had a Dauphin DTR-1 for
                        awhile; considering that DTR stood for Desktop Replacement, it was quite
                        ambitiously named. I loved my Newton MessagePad 2000 and mourned when Steve
                        Jobs went back to Apple and killed the MessagePad line, although he eventually
                        released the iPad, so I forgave him. I owned several iterations of Compaq iPaqs
                        because I refused to buy a Palm Pilot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-3 mr-3 ">
                        All of this is to say that, from the moment I had a computer of my own, I was
                        driven to understand what made it work, and what I could make it do. I knew
                        that when there was a problem, it was because something was wrong in the
                        software or hardware and that if I understood how they worked, I would
                        eventually be able to figure out and fix these problems; and I was relentlessly
                        driven to do so. I excelled at troubleshooting and knew that the more I knew,
                        the more easily I would be able to troubleshoot and resolve hardware and
                        software issues. IT was constantly evolving, and there was always more to know.
                    </p>

                        I have recently been learning web development, and it has rekindled in me the
                        early excitement and fascination that I had with my first computer and numerous
                        other computing gadgets. Web development is nothing but troubleshooting, and I
                        love it. Scroll down a bit to see how I have fared at it so far.

                            <p class="float-left ml-3 mr-3 mb-3 ">Pencil Me In is a group project. We developed it to experiment
                                with node, express, and developing our own API. The back end is MySQL. We use JSON web tokens for authentication and a library
                                called fullCalendar for the gui calendar. The idea is that small business/gig workers can have clients
                                log in and schedule their own appointments with them. Providers can also create appointments for blocks
                                of time that they don't want clients to schedule them. When registering, providers choose their business
                                hours and these are emphasized in the calendar to show clients where to create appointments. Feel free to
                                register as a client or provider and check it out.
