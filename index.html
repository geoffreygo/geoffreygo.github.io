                        I live in Denver, Colorado with my wife and 3 dogs. Yes 3. I'd like to say I'm the man of the house (being the only man in
                        the house) but the truth is that my dogs pretty much run me. They'd prefer if I didn't have to work,
                        so that we could visit parks, smell new things, and graze on the odd patch of grass wherever we go.
                        Unfortunately, someone has to pay the bills, so I have some explaining to do every morning as I leave
                        the house. They are unmoved though, and act like leaving them is the biggest betrayal that they have
                        ever experienced.
                    </p>

                        On the upside, my return home is a cause for manic celebration. There is barking, howling, and jumping as they swarm me in
                        their joy. Each day is subject to a level of jubilation that would lead one to believe I had just
                        returned from a month-long trip. This is what I must keep in mind as I look down at their dejected little
                        faces each morning: that I will cause them unprecedented frolic before the day is out. Each homecoming
                        is a new holiday.
                    </p>

                        But what, you say, is this work I mention in passing? I left a lucrative career in bookselling back in 1999 to get my MCSE
                        and join the toiling tech faithful. If you're really interested in what happened next, click on the linkedin icon in the

                        in turns. If you'd like to know more, feel free to email me or check out my github with the other icons in the header. And be sure
                        to scroll down to check out my latest coding projects. Now excuse me as I go and spread more joy.

                                with using ajax and APIs. We utilize the ticketmaster API to retrieve the concert data, and
                                Google Maps for geolocation and event maps. This project also utilizes Google firebase for
                                authentication (either through Google or by creating an account directly on the site) to
                                allow users to save their favorite artists. When logged in, you will see any upcoming concerts

                                by typing the title of a movie in the text box at the right and clicking Add Button. They
